## Installation

### *Scss*
The main scss file to include to your main `.scss` file is located at the `./src/scss/list-groups.scss`. As a *Trowel Component*, it also requires two dependencies to compile the *scss* code. Here an *scss* installation snippet.

```
// Trowel core (need to be imported first)
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-core/src/trowel';

// Trowel List-groups
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-list-groups/src/scss/list-groups';
```
