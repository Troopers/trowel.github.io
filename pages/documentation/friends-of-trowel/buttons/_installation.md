## Installation

### *SCSS*
The main scss file to include to your main `.scss` file is located at the `./src/scss/buttons.scss`. As a *Trowel Component*, it also requires two dependencies to compile the *scss* code. Here an *scss* installation snippet.

```
// Trowel core (need to be imported first)
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-core/src/trowel';

// Trowel Component Buttons
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-buttons/src/scss/buttons';
```
