## Installation

### *SCSS*
The main scss file to include to your main `.scss` file is located at the `./src/scss/Layouts.scss`. As a *Trowel Component*, it also requires two dependencies to compile the *scss* code. Here an *scss* installation snippet.

```
// Trowel core (need to be imported first)
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-core/src/trowel';

// Trowel Layouts
@import './path/to/dependencies/trowel-layouts/src/scss/layouts';
```
