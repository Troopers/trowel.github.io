*Trowel* is a scss plugin for visual component framework (like bootstrap, foundation, etc.). What we call *Trowel component* is a visual component using Trowel.

A *Trowel component* can be built by anyone (see [Create your own Trowel component](/documentation/trowel-core/create-a-component/)), and you use one of the official component listed in the Friends of Trowel section.

We will see in this chapter how to install, use and customize a *Trowel component*.
