*Trowel* is a scss plugin for visual component framework (like bootstrap, foundation, etc.). What we call *Trowel component* is a visual component using Trowel.

A *Trowel component* can be built by anyone (see [Create your own Trowel component](/documentation/trowel-core/create-a-component/)), and you use one of the official component listed in the Friends of Trowel section.

We will see in this chapter how to install, use and customize a *Trowel component*. But first let's see and check sereral things before learning how to use Trowel.

### Advanced Sass features
Trowel is based on some key features of scss like `variables`, `mixins`, `functions`, `map`. Make sure to be confortable with Sass before reading further.

### Atomic design
Trowel is designed for a specific kind of methodology. It is a "component focus" framework which means it is made to design visual component independently that you will then assemble into a web page. This methodology is well known as **atomic design**. We strongly recommand you to read [this article](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) written by *Brad Frost* the creator of the Atomic Design.

### BEM
Trowel is also deeply based on [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) which is a methodology for naming css classes. Even if we can change the syntax the classes generated with Trowel, the BEM philosophy will remain, which make it the last prerequisite required before playing with Trowel.
