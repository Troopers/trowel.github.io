A *Trowel component* is CSS framework or visual component designed with the trowel tools and can be built by anyone (see [Create your own Trowel component](/documentation/trowel-core/create-a-component/)). The [Friends of Trowel](https://github.com/FriendsOfTrowel) organization regroups all the official *Trowel components* maintained by the Trowel core team.

We will see in this chapter how to install, use and customize those *Trowel component*.
