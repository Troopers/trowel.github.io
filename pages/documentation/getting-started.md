## Welcome aboard !

As easy as Trowel is, it requires some basic knowledge on some very popular technologies and design patterns :

### Advanced Sass features
Trowel is based on some key features of scss like `variables`, `mixins`, `functions`, `map`. Make sure to be comfortable with Sass before reading further.

### Atomic design
Trowel is designed for a specific kind of methodology. It is a "component focus" framework, which means it is made to design visual component independently that you will then assemble into a web page. This methodology is well known as **atomic design**. We strongly recommend you to read [this article](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) written by *Brad Frost* the creator of the Atomic Design.

### BEM
Trowel is also deeply based on [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/) which is a methodology for naming css classes. Even if we can change the syntax of the classes generated with Trowel, the BEM philosophy will remain, which make it the last prerequisite required before playing with Trowel.
